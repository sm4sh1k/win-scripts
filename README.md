Useful scripts for Windows system administrators
==============

My collection of scripts for Windows operating system.
Most of them were used to automate administering of Windows-based infrastructure with Active Directory domain.
All these scripts were written by me sometimes using adopted code from various free scripts founded on the Web.

Scripts are placed to folders according to the way they have to be used on. Scripts designed to run via Group Policy politics at startup (or shutdown) are placed in *machines* folder. Scripts meant to be run under user account during the logon (or logoff) procedure are placed in *users* folder. Scripts designed to be run under domain administrator account (or another privileged user) interactively are situated in *admins* folder. Scripts developed for using on servers with scheduled tasks are placed in *servers* folder. The last portion of scripts are placed in *workstations* folder. These scripts are designed to use on remote workstations (such as bank terminals working under Windows XP Embedded) without Active Directory environment.

To see more information about each script just open appropriate folder.
